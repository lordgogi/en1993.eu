        can use to expand capability of their own programs and tools.</p>

        <p>Main focus of site is:
          <ul>
            <li>Calculation of Cross section properties</li>
            <li>Bolted Connection sizing and checking</li>
            <li>Welded Connection sizing and checking</li>
            <li>Structural checks of plated elements and stiffened panels</li>
            <li>Various structural checks of elements to EN1993 and AISC</li>
